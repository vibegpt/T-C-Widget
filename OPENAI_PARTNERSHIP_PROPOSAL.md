# OpenAI Partnership Proposal - LegalEasy for Agentic Commerce

**To:** OpenAI Partnerships Team (partnerships@openai.com)
**From:** LegalEasy
**Date:** October 2025
**Re:** Strategic Partnership for ChatGPT Agentic Commerce

---

## Executive Summary

LegalEasy is a consumer transparency platform that analyzes merchant policies in plain English. We've built a fully functional ChatGPT Action that enhances the Agentic Commerce shopping experience by helping customers understand refund policies, shipping terms, privacy practices, and legal obligations **before** they purchase.

**We're requesting partnership to integrate LegalEasy as a default/featured tool in ChatGPT's shopping experience.**

### Key Value Propositions:

1. **Increases Conversion:** Customers buy with confidence when they understand policies
2. **Reduces Support Costs:** Answers policy questions automatically during shopping
3. **Prevents Chargebacks:** Customers know what to expect before purchase
4. **Builds Trust:** Transparency is a competitive advantage for ChatGPT Commerce
5. **Merchant-Neutral:** Works with any merchant selling via ChatGPT

---

## The Problem

### For Customers Shopping via ChatGPT:

When customers ask about merchant policies during shopping, they currently:
- Get generic/uncertain answers from ChatGPT
- Must leave ChatGPT to read complex legal documents
- Face confusion about refunds, shipping, privacy
- Abandon purchases due to uncertainty
- Experience buyer's remorse after purchase

**Example conversation today:**
```
Customer: "What's the refund policy for this jacket?"
ChatGPT: "I don't have access to the specific merchant's refund policy.
         You should check their website for details."
Customer: [Abandons purchase or buys without understanding]
```

### For Merchants:

- Higher support ticket volume ("How do I return this?")
- More chargebacks from mismatched expectations
- Lower conversion rates due to policy confusion
- No differentiation on policy transparency

### For OpenAI/ChatGPT:

- Incomplete shopping experience
- Customer trust issues with Agentic Commerce
- Missing critical information customers need to buy
- Competitive disadvantage vs. traditional e-commerce (which displays policies)

---

## The LegalEasy Solution

### How It Works:

```
Customer in ChatGPT: "Show me winter jackets"
ChatGPT: [Displays products from merchants]

Customer: "What's the refund policy?"
ChatGPT: [Calls LegalEasy API automatically]
LegalEasy: Fetches merchant's policy from their website
LegalEasy: Analyzes using AI-powered parser
LegalEasy: Returns plain-English summary
ChatGPT: "30-day returns, items must be unworn, 15% restocking fee,
          customer pays return shipping. Would you like to see more details?"

Customer: [Buys with confidence] ✓
```

### What LegalEasy Analyzes:

✅ **Refund Policies**
- Return windows (7, 14, 30, 60 days, etc.)
- Conditions (unopened, unworn, original packaging)

✅ **Shipping Policies**
- Delivery timeframes (2-day, 5-7 days, etc.)
- Shipping costs (free, flat rate, calculated)
- Tracking availability
- International shipping

✅ **Privacy Policies**
- Data collected (email, address, browsing history)
- Third-party sharing (analytics, ads, partners)
- Data retention periods
- User rights (deletion, export, opt-out)

✅ **Terms of Service**
- Liability caps
