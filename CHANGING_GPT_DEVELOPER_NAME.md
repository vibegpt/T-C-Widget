# Changing Developer Name in Custom GPT

## Can You Change the Developer Name? ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Short answer:** Not directly in the GPT settings, BUT you can use a Builder Profile.

**By default, ChatGPT displays:**
- Your ChatGPT account name as the developer
- This is pulled from your OpenAI account settings

---

## Two Options to Display "Bagger.tools"

### Option 1: Change Your ChatGPT Account Name (Easiest)

This will change how you appear across ALL your GPTs.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/
2. Click on your profile/settings
3. Look for "Name" or "Display Name" field
4. Change it to: **Bagger.tools** or **Bagger** (your choice)
5. Save changes
6. Your GPT will now show "By Bagger.tools" instead of your personal name

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simple and immediate
- ‚úÖ Works for all your GPTs
- ‚úÖ No extra steps needed

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes your name everywhere on OpenAI platform
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Might affect your personal ChatGPT account display name

---

### Option 2: Create a Builder Profile (Professional)

This is the "official" way to have a separate brand identity for your GPTs.

**What is a Builder Profile?**
- A separate identity for your GPT creations
- Can have a different name, bio, and links than your personal account
- Useful if you're building multiple GPTs under a brand name

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/
2. Click your profile picture ‚Üí **"Settings"**
3. Look for **"Builder profile"** section
4. Click **"Set up builder profile"**
5. Fill in:
   - **Name:** Bagger.tools
   - **Bio:** AI tools for transparency and consumer rights
   - **Website:** https://bagger.tools (or https://legaleasy.tools)
6. Save the profile

**Then, when editing your GPT:**
1. Edit your LegalEasy GPT
2. In settings, you should see option to "Publish as Builder Profile"
3. Select your Bagger.tools builder profile
4. Update the GPT

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Professional separation between personal and brand
- ‚úÖ Can link to your website
- ‚úÖ Adds credibility
- ‚úÖ Personal account name stays unchanged

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires setting up builder profile first
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May not be available to all users yet (feature is rolling out)

## Recommended Approach

### If you ONLY want to build GPTs under "Bagger.tools":
**Use Option 1** - Just change your account name to "Bagger.tools"
- Simple, works immediately
- Your GPT will show "By Bagger.tools"

### If you want to keep personal name separate from brand:
**Use Option 2** - Create a Builder Profile
- More professional
- Allows you to have both personal and brand identities
- Better for long-term branding

## About "Bagger.tools" as the Brand

**Is this your parent brand for multiple tools?**
- LegalEasy could be one of several tools under Bagger.tools
- Makes sense if you're building a suite of transparency/consumer tools
- Builder profile would be perfect for this

**Or is it just for LegalEasy?**
- If Bagger.tools is specifically for LegalEasy, you might want:
  - **Developer:** Bagger.tools
  - **GPT Name:** LegalEasy - Shop Smarter
  - **Website:** legaleasy.tools (but it can redirect to bagger.tools)

---

## Current Status

Right now, your GPT shows:
- **Name:** LegalEasy - Shop Smarter ‚úÖ
- **Developer:** [Your ChatGPT account name] ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Privacy Policy:** https://legaleasy.tools/legal ‚úÖ

**To change developer to "Bagger.tools":**
1. Try Option 2 first (Builder Profile) if available
2. If not available, use Option 1 (change account name)
