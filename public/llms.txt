# PolicyCheck

> Pre-purchase seller policy verification service for AI agents. PolicyCheck analyzes e-commerce seller policies (returns, shipping, warranty, terms of service, privacy) and returns structured risk assessments to help autonomous agents make informed purchasing decisions.

PolicyCheck is an intelligence provider — it surfaces factual risk data without making binary go/no-go recommendations, preserving agent autonomy while enabling programmatic policy risk checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://policycheck.tools/api/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example-store.com"}'
```

## Key Response Fields

- `risk_score` (0–10, null if no content found)
- `grade` (A+ through F letter grade)
- `buyer_protection_score` (0–100 inverse of risk)
- `flags` (string array of detected clause type identifiers — primary field for rule-based agents)
- `risk_factors` (detailed findings with severity, source, found_in)
- `analysis_status` ("complete" | "partial" | "no_content" | "text_provided") — check this before trusting scores
- `confidence` ("high" | "medium" | "low" | "none")

## Optional: Supply Your Own Policy Text

If the seller site uses JavaScript rendering that blocks server-side fetching, agents can render the page themselves and submit the extracted text directly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://policycheck.tools/api/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"policy_text": "All sales final. No returns accepted..."}'
```
