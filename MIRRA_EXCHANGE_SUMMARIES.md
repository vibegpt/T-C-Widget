**Exchanges Analyzed**: 6
**Purpose**: User-friendly policy summaries for Mirra repository page

## 1. MEXC Global

### Risk Score: 95/100 🔴 CRITICAL

**Quick Take**: Extremely high risk. MEXC can take back your profits and confiscate your funds with vague justifications.

### 🚨 What You Need to Know

- **They can take your profits back** - Clause 21(c) allows MEXC to "clawback" any profits they claim violate their terms (definition is vague)
- **They can confiscate all your funds** - If they determine you engaged in "abnormal trading" (not clearly defined), they can seize your entire account balance
- **They can reverse your trades** - Executed trades can be cancelled retroactively under "risk control guidelines"
- **They can freeze your account anytime** - No warning required, at their sole discretion
- **You can't sue them** - Mandatory arbitration and class action waiver

### What "Abnormal Trading" Means

This is deliberately vague. Could include:
- High-frequency trading
- Large profitable trades
- Using trading bots
- Anything they decide after the fact

### ✅ What's Good

Honestly? Not much. MEXC is one of the riskiest exchanges we've analyzed.

### 📋 Before You Trade on MEXC

1. Read Clause 21(c) word-for-word
2. Never keep more funds than you're willing to lose completely
3. Document all your trades (screenshots, records)
4. Consider using Kraken, Coinbase, or another lower-risk exchange instead
5. If you must use MEXC, move profits off the platform immediately

## 2. OKX

### Risk Score: 85/100 🔴 HIGH

**Quick Take**: High risk. OKX can take your profits to pay for other traders' losses, plus reverse trades and liquidate positions.

### 🚨 What You Need to Know

- **"Socialized clawback" mechanism** - Your profits can be seized to cover OTHER users' losses during market stress (Clause 6.82)
- **Forced liquidation** - Your positions can be closed without your permission if margin requirements aren't met (Clause 6.76-6.78)
- **Trade rollback rights** - OKX can cancel, reverse, or "claw back" any transaction (Clause 4.13)
- **Asset seizure** - They can freeze, convert, or liquidate your assets to cover "insufficiencies" (Clause 7.11)
- **Auto-deleveraging (ADL)** - Your profitable positions may be reduced to cover others' losses

### What "Socialized Clawback" Means

During extreme volatility (like a flash crash), OKX has a "security fund" to cover losses. If that fund runs out, OKX can take money from **profitable traders** to pay **losing traders**.

**Example**: You made $10,000 profit trading ETH futures. Market crashes. OKX's security fund is depleted. They take $2,000 of YOUR profit to cover someone else's $50,000 loss.

### ✅ What's Good

- More transparent than MEXC about their policies
- Clearer documentation of risks
- Slightly better customer support reputation

### 📋 Before You Trade on OKX

1. Read Clauses 6.76, 6.82, 4.13, and 7.11 carefully
2. Understand margin requirements cold - forced liquidation happens fast
3. Know that even if you trade profitably, you might not keep all your gains
4. Use stop-loss orders, but know they're not guaranteed to execute
5. Consider limiting position sizes to reduce ADL risk

## 3. KuCoin

### Risk Score: 75/100 🟠 HIGH

**Quick Take**: High risk, but more transparent than MEXC/OKX. Standard aggressive CEX policies. No explicit "clawback" clause detected.

### 🚨 What You Need to Know

- **Total loss is possible** - Terms explicitly state you can lose everything
- **Order cancellation rights** - KuCoin can reverse or cancel any executed order at their discretion
- **Forced liquidation** - Standard on futures/margin (positions closed without consent)
- **Auto-deleveraging (ADL)** - Your positions may be reduced during volatility
- **Stop-loss not guaranteed** - Stop-loss orders may fail during high volatility
- **Geographic restrictions** - Banned in US and China

### What "Total Loss" Means

Unlike banks (FDIC insured) or stock brokers (SIPC protected), crypto exchanges have **zero insurance**. If:
- The exchange is hacked
- The exchange goes bankrupt
- Your account is frozen
- Market volatility wipes you out

...you may lose 100% of your funds with no recourse.

### ✅ What's Good

- No explicit "clawback" provision (unlike MEXC/OKX)
- Clearer dispute process than some competitors
- Better transparency about risks
- 24/7 customer support

### 📋 Before You Trade on KuCoin

1. Understand stop-loss orders are NOT guaranteed
2. Check if your country is restricted (US/China banned)
3. Review their data privacy policy if concerned about international transfers
4. Limit exposure during high volatility events
5. Don't assume anything is "safe" - this is crypto

## 4. Kraken

### Risk Score: 60/100 🟡 MEDIUM

**Quick Take**: Medium risk. US-regulated, which means better protections. No clawback clause. Best option of the exchanges analyzed.

### 🚨 What You Need to Know

- **Margin trading can exceed deposit** - You can lose more than you put in (leverage)
- **Account termination at discretion** - Kraken can suspend/terminate accounts, but with clearer rules than offshore exchanges
- **Forced liquidation** - Applies to margin products only (not spot trading)
- **Auto-deleveraging** - Applies to futures only (not spot/margin)
- **Binding arbitration** - Disputes go to arbitration, not court

### What "US-Regulated" Means

Kraken operates under US law (based in San Francisco). This means:
- ✅ No explicit clawback provision
- ✅ No class action waiver (you CAN join class actions)
- ✅ Clearer regulatory oversight
- ✅ Better consumer protections than Seychelles/Cayman exchanges
- ✅ More legal recourse if things go wrong

### ✅ What's Good

- Best regulatory protection of exchanges analyzed
- No "clawback" clause detected
- No "class action waiver" (you can join class actions)
- ADL and forced liquidation limited to specific products (not all trading)
- Long track record (founded 2011)
- US-based support team

### ⚠️ Still Risky

- Margin trading can still wipe you out
- Account can be suspended (though with clearer rules)
- Arbitration requirement (can't sue in regular court)
- Crypto is inherently volatile

### 📋 Before You Trade on Kraken

1. If using margin/futures, read the margin trading risks carefully
2. Complete KYC verification ASAP to avoid account issues
3. Understand that even with US regulation, legal recourse is limited
4. Monitor policy changes (though they're better about notifications)
5. Start small - don't deposit your life savings

## 5. Bitget

### Risk Score: 80/100 🔴 HIGH

**Quick Take**: High risk. Extensive disclaimers, total loss explicitly possible, terms can change without notice.

### 🚨 What You Need to Know

- **Total loss explicitly stated** - "Trading digital assets involves... potential total loss of investment"
- **Transactions are irreversible** - Send to wrong address? Too bad. Blockchain is final.
- **Extreme volatility** - "Value may fluctuate significantly over a short period"
- **Forced liquidation** - Standard on derivatives
- **Auto-deleveraging (ADL)** - Standard on derivatives
- **Terms can change without telling you** - They can modify terms without notification
- **No performance guarantees** - They promise nothing

### What "Irrevocable" Means

Unlike a bank wire (can be reversed), blockchain transactions are **permanent**. If you:
- Send BTC to the wrong address
- Fat-finger an amount (0.1 BTC instead of 0.01)
- Fall for a phishing scam

Your funds are **gone forever**. Bitget won't help. They legally can't.

### ✅ What's Good

- Very transparent about risks (honestly states you can lose everything)
- No explicit "clawback" provision detected
- Extensive FAQ and support docs
- Wide variety of trading pairs

### ⚠️ Major Red Flag

**"Terms can change without notification"** - Most exchanges notify you of changes. Bitget reserves the right to change terms silently. You're responsible for checking regularly.

### 📋 Before You Trade on Bitget

1. Understand blockchain transactions are 100% irreversible
2. Triple-check wallet addresses before sending ANYTHING
3. Don't deposit more than you can afford to lose completely
4. Check the terms monthly for changes (they won't tell you)
5. Verify you meet age requirements (18+) and KYC

## 6. Gate.io

### Risk Score: 70/100 🟠 HIGH (Estimated)

**Quick Take**: High risk assumed. Full analysis incomplete due to site access issues. Assume similar to OKX/KuCoin until confirmed otherwise.

### ⚠️ Analysis Incomplete

During our analysis, Gate.io's terms page returned errors. We estimate risk based on:
- Jurisdiction (Cayman Islands - offshore)
- Industry norms for Cayman-based exchanges
- Comparison to similar platforms (OKX, KuCoin)

### 🚨 Likely Risks (Estimated)

- **Forced liquidation** - Very likely (standard for all CEX)
- **Auto-deleveraging** - Very likely (standard on derivatives)
- **Arbitration requirement** - Very likely (offshore exchanges always have this)
- **Offshore jurisdiction** - Cayman Islands = weaker user protections

### ✅ What We Don't Know

- Whether they have clawback provisions
- Specific clause numbers or quotes
- Asset seizure rights
- Trade rollback policies

### 📋 Before You Trade on Gate.io

1. **Do your own research** - Manually read their full terms at gate.io
2. Assume high-risk policies until proven otherwise
3. Compare their terms to OKX and KuCoin (similar jurisdictions)
4. Don't deposit significant funds without confirming their policies
5. Request our full analysis update once site access is restored

## What These Scores Mean

### 🔴 CRITICAL (80-100)
Multiple severe clauses. High chance of losing funds due to exchange actions (not just market risk). Clawback provisions, asset seizure, vague enforcement triggers.

**Our Take**: Avoid if possible. If you must use, keep minimal balance and move profits immediately.

### 🟠 HIGH (65-79)
Standard aggressive CEX policies. Forced liquidation, ADL, broad termination rights. Market risk is high, exchange risk is moderate.

**Our Take**: Use with caution. Understand all risks. Don't keep large balances.

### 🟡 MEDIUM (45-64)
Better regulatory oversight or clearer terms. Still risky (it's crypto), but less likely to lose funds due to exchange actions.

**Our Take**: Best available option in this analysis. Still read terms carefully.

### 🟢 LOW (0-44)
Would indicate strong user protections, clear terms, insurance, regulation.

**Our Take**: None of the analyzed exchanges qualify. This is crypto.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Only 2 out of 6 exchanges have "clawback" provisions** (MEXC, OKX). This is a critical differentiator.

2. **US regulation matters** - Kraken (US-based) scored 15-35 points lower risk than offshore exchanges.

3. **All exchanges can result in total loss** - Not one of these exchanges guarantees your funds.

4. **Forced liquidation is universal** - Every single exchange can close your positions without consent (especially on margin/futures).

5. **Offshore = more risk** - Seychelles, Cayman Islands, Malta all have weaker consumer protections than the US.

6. **You can't sue (usually)** - Arbitration clauses and class action waivers are standard.
